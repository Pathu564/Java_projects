   - Custom Logger: Implement a custom logging solution for the application.

5. **Task Status Tracking**
   - View Completed Tasks: Display tasks marked as completed.
   - View Pending Tasks: Display tasks that are still pending.

## üõ°Ô∏è Design Patterns

This project incorporates several design patterns to ensure a scalable and maintainable codebase:

- **Singleton Pattern:** Ensures a single instance of the Schedule Manager for consistent task management.
- **Observer Pattern:** Used for conflict detection and task status updates.
- **Factory Pattern:** Simplifies task creation and management.

## üìà Usage Instructions

Once the application is running, follow the console prompts to:

1. **Add a Task:** Input task details and schedule it.
2. **View Tasks:** See a list of all tasks sorted based on start time.
3. **Update Tasks:** Modify task details as needed.
4. **Delete Tasks:** Remove tasks from the list.
5. **Check Conflicts:** Automatically check for any task overlaps.
6. **Mark as Completed:** Mark task as Completed.
7. **View Task Status:** See completed and pending tasks.

## EXERCISE-1

## BEHAVIORAL PATTERN
      Strategy Pattern
      Observer Pattern
## üïπÔ∏è Subway Surfers Game - Strategy Pattern

### Overview

The Subway Surfers Game is a simple console-based game written in Java that demonstrates the use of the Strategy Design Pattern. The player encounters different types of obstacles, and a specific strategy is applied to handle each type.

### Code Structure

1. **`ObstacleStrategy.java`**: Defines the `ObstacleStrategy` interface.
2. **`TrainStrategy.java`**: Implements behavior for train obstacles.
3. **`PillarStrategy.java`**: Implements behavior for pillar obstacles.
4. **`CoinStrategy.java`**: Implements behavior for coin obstacles.
5. **`PlatformStrategy.java`**: Implements behavior for platform obstacles.
6. **`SignStrategy.java`**: Implements behavior for sign obstacles.
7. **`Player.java`**: Contains game logic and handles obstacles.
8. **`SubwaySurfersGame.java`**: Starts the game and manages the game loop.

### Installation

1. **Download or Clone the Repository**
2. **Navigate to Project Directory**
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your_project_directory
   ```
3. **Compile the Java Files**
   ```bash
   javac *.java
   ```
4. **Run the Game**
   ```bash
   java SubwaySurfersGame
   ```

### Usage

- Enter the type of obstacle (train, pillar, coin, platform, sign) or `quit` to end the game.

## üì∫ YouTube Subscription System - Observer Pattern

### Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of the **Observer Pattern** through a YouTube subscription system. The system allows a YouTube channel to notify its subscribers whenever a new video is uploaded. This pattern is used to manage and notify multiple subscribers efficiently when changes occur.

### Design Pattern: Observer Pattern

The **Observer Pattern** is a behavioral design pattern where an object (subject) maintains a list of its dependents (observers) and notifies them of any state changes. This pattern provides a way to subscribe and unsubscribe observers to be notified of changes in the subject.

### Components

- **Subject:** The `YouTubeChannel` interface defines methods for subscribing, unsubscribing, and notifying observers.
- **Concrete Subject:** `MyYouTubeChannel` class implements the `YouTubeChannel` interface and maintains a list of subscribers.
- **Observer:** The `Subscriber` interface defines the method `update` to receive notifications.
- **Concrete Observer:** `UserSubscriber` class implements the `Subscriber` interface to handle notifications of new videos.
- **Client:** The `ChannelOwnerMenu` class provides a menu for the channel owner to manage subscribers and upload videos.

### How It Works

1. **Subscription Management:** Subscribers can subscribe to or unsubscribe from the YouTube channel. Each subscriber is notified when a new video is uploaded.
2. **Video Upload:** When a new video is uploaded to the channel, all subscribed users receive a notification with the video title.
3. **Interactive Menu:** The system provides an interactive menu for the channel owner to perform operations like adding/removing subscribers and uploading new videos.

### How to Run

1. **Compile the Code:** Ensure all Java files are compiled.
2. **Run the Application:** Start the application to interact with the channel management system.
3. **Interact with the Menu:** Use the menu to add subscribers, remove them, or upload new videos. Subscribers will receive notifications based on their subscription status.

### Summary

This project showcases the Observer Pattern, where the YouTube channel acts as the subject, and subscribers are the observers.

The channel notifies all its subscribers when a new video is uploaded, illustrating how observers can be managed and notified effectively in a real-world scenario.
